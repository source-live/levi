# Draw abstract with three lines of code!
```python
from levi import Art

newart = Art(16,1000)
newart.save('newart')
```
This will create an awesome artwork that you can save!  Only 3 lines of code!  Amazing!

You can also draw normally:
```
from levi import *

go_up()
go_down()
go_left()
go_right()
go_up()
save('newart')
```
